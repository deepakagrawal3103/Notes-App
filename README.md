Notes App
A simple and interactive Notes Application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. The app uses localStorage to ensure that the notes persist even after refreshing or closing the browser.

Project Overview
This Notes App allows users to:

Create new notes dynamically by clicking the "Create Notes" button.
Edit the content of each note by clicking on it.
Delete notes by clicking the delete icon within each note.
Persist data across sessions by storing notes in the browser's localStorage.
The app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring it looks good across different devices.
